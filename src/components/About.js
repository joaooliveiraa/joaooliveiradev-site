                I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. I
                can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. I also love photography, a hobby
                I'm taking along since the good old film cameras.

                For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including
                popular frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS. I also make the web pretty by using Sass,
                CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the back-end I also work with Javascript (NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, etc). But, of
                course, whenever the project requires PHP, I do PHP as well (Wordpress, Laravel, etc).

              <p>
                I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign,
                Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry standards and I love working with them. I'm
                not limited to them, though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications
                that I've been working with.

                User interfaces, brochures, books, branding... You name it! As I mentioned, creating
                pretty things is particularly important for me.
